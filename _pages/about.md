I am Assistant Professor of Political Science at Bryant University in Smithfield, RI. I earned my Ph.D. (2024) and M.A. (2020) in political science from the University of Maryland and my B.A. <i>summa cum laude</i> and Phi Beta Kappa in political science from the University of Tennessee in 2017, where I also completed the Chancellor’s Honors Program and the departmental honors program.

My research centers on American politics, with particular focus on political representation, interest groups, legislative studies, and polarization. I am especially interested in how the structure and composition of issue spaces shape group formation, strategy, and advocacy. My dissertation developed a theoretical framework showing that interest groups do not operate in isolation, but rather interact - formally and informally - within a broader policy ecosystem. Some of this work, along with related projects, has been published or is forthcoming in <i>Political Science Research and Methods</i>, <i>Political Research Quarterly</i>, <i>Interest Groups & Advocacy</i>, and <i>Pursuit</i>. 

In the classroom, I aim to cultivate intellectual seriousness, political relevance, and personal belonging. I combine traditional lecture with discussion, current events, and active learning strategies that meet students where they are — whether they are majors or encountering politics for the first time. I believe that development matters more than polish, and I work to foster emergent confidence: the kind of belief that grows as students wrestle with hard ideas, take risks, and begin to see themselves as political thinkers. In addition to teaching, I value mentoring as a space for individualized growth, and I strive to guide students beyond the classroom toward meaningful academic and professional opportunities.
