My pedagogical philosophy is grounded in the belief that intellectual growth and personal belonging are deeply intertwined. 
I design my courses to be spaces where students can engage seriously with political systems while also discovering (and believing in) 
their own capacity to think critically and contribute meaningfully. I combine traditional lecture with dynamic discussion and integration of current events, 
helping students connect institutional complexity to real-world stakes. I expect deep engagement from my class, but I also recognize that progress matters more than perfection. 
What I value most is a studentâ€™s willingness to show up, wrestle with hard ideas, and make progress over time. I actively work to cultivate emergent confidence 
that comes from consistent effort, honest reflection, and being taken seriously by faculty. I provide individualized support to meet students where they are. My goal is that students leave my classroom not only better informed about politics, 
but also more confident in their ability to participate in, critically evaluate, and reshape parts of the world around them.
