At the heart of my pedagogy is the belief that intellectual growth and personal belonging are deeply intertwined. 
I design my courses to be spaces where students can engage seriously with political systems while also discovering (and believing in) 
their own capacity to think critically, speak thoughtfully, and contribute meaningfully. I combine traditional lecture with dynamic discussion and current events, 
helping students connect institutional complexity to real-world stakes. I expect deep engagement, but I also recognize that development matters more than polish. 
What I value most is a student’s willingness to show up, wrestle with hard ideas, and make progress over time. I work to cultivate emergent confidence 
that comes not from immediate mastery but from consistent effort, honest reflection, and being taken seriously. I provide individualized support to meet students where they are, 
celebrating growth even when it doesn’t follow a straight line. My goal is that students leave my classroom not only better informed about politics, 
but also more confident in their ability to participate in, critically evaluate, and reshape the world around them.
